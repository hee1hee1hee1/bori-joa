<p><strong>A design is <u>a concept of or proposal</u> for an object, a process, or a system.</strong> Design refers to something that is or has been intentionally created by a thinking agent, though it is sometimes used to refer to the nature of something its design. <u>The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.</u> In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan may also be considered to be a design (such as in some artwork and craftwork).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>A design is expected to have a purpose within a certain context,</strong> usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, and to take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, environmental or socio-political considerations. Typical examples of designs include <u>architectural</u> and <u>engineering drawings</u>, circuit diagrams, sewing patterns and less tangible artefacts such as business process models.</p>
